As students living in Berkeley, we are frequently exposed to the unfortunate circumstances so many people are forced to live with as a result of high living expenses, a lack of available jobs, and so much more. While we see these situations almost daily, we felt we had not done nearly enough to help. So we created HelPin: a web app dedicated to connecting people in need with people who are in a position to help. Through this web app, people are able to help out as much or as little as they want to. Upon seeing or interacting with someone in need, they are able to drop a location pin, with which they can add information concerning what that person needs. HelPin users can then access these different descriptions and offer help or supplies to the person in need.
